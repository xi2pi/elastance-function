# elastance-function

by Christian Winkler, M.Sc.

This is a study about the elastance function of the left ventricle. I focused on the normalized elastance function which was used in publication about the mechanics of cardiovascular system and heart. I summarized some important papers referring to the elastance function in the following blog post:

[Publications about the elastance function](https://xi2pi.com/elastance-function-of-the-left-ventricle#more-255)

Following figure shows the elastance function that was published by [Kung et al. (2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5101033/).

You can find the Python script for the function in this repository.
